For this example, let's create an algorithm that solves the following problem:

Problem: Efficient Path Finding in a Dynamic Maze with Teleportation Points

Imagine a maze where:
1. The walls can change over time.
2. There are teleportation points that can move you to random locations.
3. The goal is to find the shortest path from start to end, considering the changing environment.

This problem combines elements of pathfinding, dynamic environments, and randomness, making it a unique challenge.

Let's implement a solution using a modified A* algorithm that accounts for these dynamic elements:


```python
import heapq
import random

class DynamicMaze:
    def __init__(self, width, height, wall_change_prob=0.1, teleport_prob=0.05):
        self.width = width

        self.teleport_prob = teleport_prob
        self.maze = [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
        self.teleport_points = []

    def initialize_maze(self):
        # Randomly place walls and teleport points
        for y in range(self.height):
            for x in range(self.width):
                if random.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance of being a wall
                    self.maze[y][x] = 1
                elif random.random() < 0.05:  # 5% chance of being a teleport point
                    self.maze[y][x] = 2
                    self.teleport_points.append((x, y))

    def get_neighbors(self, x, y):
        neighbors = []
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < self.width and 0 <= ny < self.height and self.maze[ny][nx] != 1:
                neighbors.append((nx, ny))
        return neighbors

                    self.maze[y][x] = 1 - self.maze[y][x]  # Flip between wall and empty
                elif random.random() < self.teleport_prob:
                    self.maze[y][x] = 2 if self.maze[y][x] != 2 else 0
                    if self.maze[y][x] == 2:
                        self.teleport_points.append((x, y))

This implementation creates a novel algorithm for pathfinding in a dynamic maze with teleportation points. Here's what makes it unique:

1. Dynamic Environment: The maze updates after each step, simulating a changing environment.
2. Teleportation: The algorithm handles random teleportation points, adding an element of non-determinism.
3. Adaptive A*: The A* algorithm is modified to handle both the changing walls and the teleportation points.

To use this algorithm:

1. Create a `DynamicMaze` object with the desired dimensions.
2. Initialize the maze with `initialize_maze()`.
3. Define start and goal points.
4. Call `dynamic_astar(maze, start, goal)` to find the path.

This algorithm solves a unique computational problem by combining elements of pathfinding, dynamic environments, and random teleportation. It could be useful in scenarios like game development, robotics in changing environments, or modeling complex systems with unpredictable elements.

Remember, this is a basic implementation and can be further optimized and expanded based on specific requirements or additional constraints you might want to add to make it even more unique.
